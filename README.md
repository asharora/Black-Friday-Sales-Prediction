## Project Description
Black Friday marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping festival across the US. On Black Friday big shopping giants like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. lure customers by offering discounts and deals on different product categories. The product categories range from electronic items, Clothing, kitchen appliances, DÃ©cor. Research has been carried out to predict sales by various researchers. The analysis of this data serves as a basis to provide discounts on various product items. With the purpose of analyzing and predicting the sales, we have used three models. The dataset Black Friday Sales Dataset available on Kaggle has been used for analysis and prediction purposes. The models used for prediction are linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as a performance evaluation measure. Random Forest Regressor outperforms the other models with the least MSE score.

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
